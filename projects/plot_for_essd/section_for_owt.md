## Holistic Optical Water Type Classification Scheme

The optical classification of the diverse water bodies in the study region is performed using the holistic Optical Water Type (OWT) framework developed by Bi and Hieronymi (2024). Unlike traditional approaches that cluster normalized reflectance spectra directly, this knowledge-driven framework classifies waters based on three derived optical variables: the Apparent Visible Wavelength ($AVW$), the Box-Cox transformed Spectral Area ($A_{BC}$), and the Normalized Difference Index ($NDI$). These three variables project the high-dimensional hyperspectral information into a concise three-dimensional optical space, effectively capturing variations in both spectral shape and magnitude (Fig. XXXa).

Each variable represents a distinct optical characteristic (Fig. XXXb-c). The $AVW$ acts as a spectral centroid, indicating the dominant hue of the water, ranging from short wavelengths in clear blue waters to longer wavelengths in turbid or productive waters. The $A_{BC}$, calculated from the integration of reflectance at red, green, and blue bands, quantifies the overall brightness or magnitude of the spectrum, which is primarily driven by particulate scattering. The $NDI$ captures specific spectral shape features around the green and red peaks, aiding in the discrimination of phytoplankton-dominated waters from those dominated by non-algal particles.

The framework defines ten distinct OWTs (Classes 1 to 7) representing the continuum from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic and extremely turbid waters (Fig. XXXd). A key feature of this scheme, addressing the optical complexity of coastal transitions, is the subdivision of certain classes into "a" and "b" variants (e.g., 3a/3b, 4a/4b). While "a" and "b" variants share similar spectral shapes (and thus similar $AVW$), they differ significantly in magnitude ($A_{BC}$). The "a" variants typically represent waters dominated by absorption or moderate scattering, appearing darker. In contrast, the "b" variants represent high-scattering conditions with significantly higher reflectance, such as those caused by coccolithophore blooms (OWT 3b, 4b) or suspended mineral sediments. OWT 5a and 5b specifically characterize productive waters with high phytoplankton biomass, where 5b represents hyper-eutrophic conditions with distinct vegetation-like spectral features in the near-infrared. OWT 6 and 7 represent the extremes of optically complex waters, dominated by high concentrations of total suspended matter (bright brown) and colored dissolved organic matter (dark/black), respectively.

The classification is implemented using a fuzzy logic approach based on the Mahalanobis distance in the three-dimensional variable space. For each satellite observation, the algorithm calculates the membership probability for each OWT. The final class assignment is determined by the maximum membership, while the total membership serves as a quality indicator of how well the observed spectrum fits within the defined optical universe.
